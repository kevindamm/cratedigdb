# Cue files for [CrateDig DB](https://cratedigdb.com/)

> ![Note]
> The schema is initially being developed in Chanfana/Zod (see the `/worker/api`
> directory).  This is then converted into an OpenAPI spec, and that can be
> transpiled into Cue and used within Go.  Somewhere in there I will have either
> committed to Cue as an intermediate representation across other services, or
> have given up on it as an interlingua at all.  Check again in a few months,
> we'll see!
